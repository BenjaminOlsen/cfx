# cfx

cfx is a C library for performing a host of arithmetic computations with arbitrary precision integers.

cfx used to mean one thing, something around 'Factorization into prime eXponents in C', but it's constantly changing so forget about what it means - its just cfx...

## License
The cfx big integer library is dual-licensed.
You may choose to use it under either of the following licenses:

LGPL v3 (or later) — the GNU Lesser General Public License.

You can use cfx in proprietary or open-source projects.

If you modify cfx itself and distribute it, you must publish your changes under the LGPL.

Dynamic linking is always fine; static linking is permitted if you provide a way for users to relink with a modified cfx.

GPL v2 (or later) — the GNU General Public License.

You can use cfx in GPL-licensed software, including GPLv2-only projects.

If you distribute a project that includes cfx under the GPL path, the entire project must be licensed under the GPL as well.

In short:
- If you’re writing open source, pick GPL v2+ or GPL v3+.
- If you’re writing closed source, pick LGPL v3+.
